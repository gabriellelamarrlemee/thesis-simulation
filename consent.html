						<h2>Consent for participation in a research study</h2>
						<p>Study Title: Analysis of the School Choice Decision-Making Process</p>
						<p>Principal Investigator: Ann McDonald</p>
						<p>Student Researcher: Gabrielle LaMarr LeMee</p>
						<p>IRB Study Number: 18-03-19</p>
						<p>Request to Participate in Research </p>
						<p>We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based online survey. The survey is part of a research study whose purpose is to learn more about attitudes on school choice/policy and the decision-making process. This survey should take about 7-10 minutes to complete.</p>
						<p>The decision to participate in this research project is voluntary. You do not have to participate.</p>
						<p>The possible risks or discomforts of the study are minimal and unlikely. You may feel a little emotional distress answering personal survey questions and interacting with the simulation, however, it is expected that this will be minimal. There is also the potential risk of compromised data in the circumstance that the survey results data file is stolen. However, this is unlikely and loss of confidentiality is not a risk because there will not be any identifiable information collected.</p>
						<p>Benefits include $3.00 for your participation in the survey and your responses may help us learn more about the topic. MTurk does not allow for prorated compensation.  In the event of an incomplete HIT, you must contact the research team and compensation will be determined based on what was completed and at the researchers' discretion.</p>
						<p>PLEASE NOTE: This study contains a number of checks to make sure that participants are finishing the tasks honestly and completely.  As long as you read the instructions and complete the tasks, your HIT will be approved.  If you fail these checks, your HIT will be rejected.</p>
						<p>Your part in this study is anonymous to the researcher(s). However, because of the nature of web-based surveys, it is possible that respondents could be identified by the IP address or other electronic record associated with the response. Neither the researcher nor anyone involved with this survey will be capturing those data. Any reports or publications based on this research will use only group data and will not identify you or any individual as being affiliated with this project. Your Mechanical Turk Worker ID will be used to distribute payment to you but will not be stored with the research data we collect from you.  Please be aware that your MTurk Worker ID can potentially be linked to information about you on your Amazon public profile page, depending on the settings you have for your Amazon profile.  We will not be accessing any personally identifying information about you that you may have put on your Amazon public profile page.</p>
